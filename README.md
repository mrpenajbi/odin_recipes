Here this is the time that all HTML knowledge is put together, this is where a 
website will be constructed, by creating a basic recipe website.

While backing up to git through LINUX we will see hopefully a finished website here we go!

First Step- is to create a directory in my repos file that pulld the repositiory that I created on github.com useing the SSH provided by github.

Second Step- Created this README.md file that you are reading.

Intial Structure - index. html file with a header 

Recipe Page - contains the header of my favorit recipe in this case it will be a margharita pizza 

recipe page content - ingrediants will be an unordered list

	           - steps will be in an ordered list 

Add more recipes - will be just me adding other recipe content no more than two

After this is done I should succesfully link the pages to the index html.
